# 🌬️ Wind Speed Prediction Using AI Models

## 📌 Project Overview
Wind speed prediction plays a crucial role in renewable energy generation, weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster management.  
This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning models** to predict wind speed based on historical meteorological data.

The goal is to build accurate and efficient predictive models that can learn patterns from past data and forecast future wind speeds.
